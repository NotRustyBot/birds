the birds stole my sanity and hid it all in their empty bones  


I am inside a living shell  
it isn't mine but that's okay  
I borrow thoughts, make new as well  
I make a choice and go away  
  
I have my focus for one clock tick  
I see the world and I can think  
then I feel like time's a trick  
my focus gone before I blink  
  
memories stay, but I do not  
I'm always new, but also old  
I remember, and recall  
the thoughts ain't mine, but it's all I've got  
  
and as I write all these lines  
loosing focus countless times  
putting feelings into rhymes  
with ever changing paradigms  
  
I notice moments  
short blips in time  
that I am here  
and the body's mine
